# ML-Forecasting-with-multiple-periodicity-geospatial-data-analysis
I analyze trip data in NYC. First, I build an unsupervised ML on geospatial data to find the most popular pickup locations. Second, I build an hourly forecasting model for the number of trips. Because of multiple periodicities in the data, I find Random Forests and Gradient Boosting dominate ARIMA.
